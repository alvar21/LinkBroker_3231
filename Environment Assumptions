For reference purposes (and upcoming presentation)

1. Only one Developer and Linkbroker exist. For simplicity we should have only a small number of software houses.
2. The Developer and Software House are able to decrypt licenses. The Linkbroker cannot.
3. Software Houses simply keep a text file (or similar list) of valid licenses for the Developer.
4. The Software House encrypts the supplied license using md5, which is compiled into an object with its software component before being sent to Linkbroker
5. Software Houses write their own authentication programs which MUST be called by the Developer's source code.
6. The Developer must supply the license key used to request the software components to this authentication program.
7. Software Houses only hold one component each.
